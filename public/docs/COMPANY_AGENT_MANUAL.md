## Getting Started

### What is IPAP?

IPAP (Insurance Products Aggregation Platform) is your all-in-one tool for managing insurance services. As an Insurance Company Agent, you can:

- ✅ Register and manage your customers
- ✅ Find customer policies by Policy ID
- ✅ Process premium payments for customers
- ✅ Track payment transactions

### How Is This Different from a Standard Agent?

As an Insurance Company Agent, you work exclusively with your insurance company's products. You **do not** create new quotes - instead, you find existing policies and help customers with payments.

| Feature            | Standard Agent | Company Agent |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------- |
| Create Quotes      | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No         |
| Find Policies      | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes        |
| Process Payments   | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes        |

| Multiple Companies | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No         |

### How Did I Get My Account?

Your account was created by your Insurance Company. Here's how it works:

1. You provide your documents to the Insurance Company:

   - Passport photo (yours and guarantor's)
   - ID cards (yours and guarantor's)
   - Education qualification certificate
   - Years of experience

2. The Insurance Company creates your agent profile with all your information

3. You receive your login credentials:
   - Your **email address** (used for login)
   - A **password**

If you haven't received your login details, please contact your Insurance Company administrator.
